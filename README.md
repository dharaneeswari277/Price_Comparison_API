Database

This project uses SQLite as the database for storing product information. SQLite was chosen for the following reasons:


Simplicity: SQLite is a self-contained, serverless database engine that is easy to set up and use.

Lightweight: It has a small footprint, making it ideal for small to medium-sized applications.

No Configuration Required: It doesnâ€™t require a separate server process, and the database can be created simply by opening a file.

Database Schema

The products table has the following columns:

id: Integer, primary key, auto-incremented.

name: Text, name of the product.

price: Real, price of the product.

retailer: Text, name of the retailer.
